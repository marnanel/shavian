<p>The <a href="/">Shavian alphabet</a> was named after George Bernard Shaw, who paid for it.  "Shavian" is the Latin-like adjective corresponding to the name "Shaw".</p>

<p>The ordinary spelling does not show whether the first vowel in "Shavian" is long or short.  However, the alphabet's designer, Kingsley Read, <a href="/shawscript/03/answers-to-questions-a-word-game">spelled it with the Shavian letter "age"</a>, the vowel in the word "clay".</p>

<p>Some write the <a href="/learn/naming_dot">naming dot</a> before "Shavian".  Our usual convention is not to use the naming dot with adjectives, so we omit it.</p>
