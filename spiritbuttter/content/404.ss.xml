<p>So many years have passed since first you sought<br/>
the lands beyond the edges of the sky,<br/>
so many moons reflected in your eye,<br/>
(familiar newness, fear of leaving port),<br/>
since first you sought, and failed, and learned to fall,<br/>
(first hope, then cynicism, silent dread,<br/>
the countless stars, still counting overhead<br/>
the seconds to your final voyage of all...)<br/>
and last, in glory gold and red around<br/>
your greatest search, your final quest to know!<br/>
yet... ashes drift, the embers cease to glow,<br/>
and darkened life in frozen death is drowned;<br/>
and ashes on the swell are seen no more.<br/>
The silence surges. <b>Error 404</b>.</p>
