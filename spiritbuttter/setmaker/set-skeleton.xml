This is the Shavian Set, version $version.

The file shavian-set.xml contains a mapping of Latin-alphabet words
to Shavian-alphabet words.

This file, and the entire package, is offered in the hope that it
will be useful, but without any warranty.

Each <w> element may have the following attributes:
   l - the Latin-alphabet word.  This is always present.
   s - the Shavian-alphabet word.  This is always present.
   p - the part of speech.  This is always present.
       Where we had no source information for the part of speech,
       this is N.
   f - the source.  If this is not present, it defaults to "1".
       See below for valid values.
   d - the disambiguation.  This only appears where a Latin-alphabet
       word has several mappings.  It gives the set of parts of speech
       which can be expected to precede this word.
       However, if this attribute is "g", it should only match if the
       Latin-alphabet word begins with a capital letter; and if it is
       "h", it should only match if it does not.  This helps us
       disambiguate proper nouns and common nouns which are spelt the
       same way but pronounced differently.

The concatenation of the Latin-alphabet word with the disambiguation
(if present) will yield a unique primary key.

SOURCES
=======

Some of the pronunciation data comes from the Shavian Wiki.
These records have a zero in the "f" attribute.
This data has been hand-checked and is believed to be of high quality.
This data is released under the Creative Commons cc-by licence.
Most of the data was supplied by Thomas Thurman and Philip Newton.

Other words come from the 1962 public domain translation of
"Androcles and the Lion" into the Shavian alphabet.
These records have a "2" in the "f" attribute.

Other words come from CMUDict.
These records have a one in the "f" attribute.  (This is the default,
so in this case there is no "f" attribute.)
This does not permit a perfect mapping to Shavian, so the resulting
Shavian data is of low quality.  Therefore, Shavian Wiki data was
used in preference.
